# Humanoid Robots excursion
1. Which aspect of this robot would you like to include into your project? 
- The article focused on technology as we age.  It sounds funny but new technology can be complex for older generations.  I think older generations using our chatbot(to purchase a plane ticket) to cater to the needs of elders instead of making them confused. 
2. How is the category suitable? (You can find the category at the top of the page. You can also tell based on the filters that you chose for reaching the item in the collection).
- The category information is suitable as it provides insight into what companies are thinking about pursuing/working towards.   
3. What do you like and not like?
- I liked that this article looks out for older generations.  I think in our society the older generation can be looked down on and I am glad to see someone wants to change that narrative.  One thing I dislike is the assisting robots such as the puppy Sony created named Aibo.  I would personnally much rather have a real dog than a robot.
4. Who is the audience for this technology?
- The audience is everyone but specifically elders, people with dementia, and people taking care of elders. 
5. Comments on data and design. 
- I think the desgin of Aibo the robotic puppy and Paro the robotic seal to help children, and elders with dementia are creative and unique.  Obviously they are not real animals but if you can't have access to a real puppy than this could be beneficial.  The assisiting design of these future robots is really impactful.  Instead of having someone help lift a person in and out of bed which can be awkward for both parties involved a robot takes that awkwardness away.  And a person can use that person at any time without needing to notify a person.
